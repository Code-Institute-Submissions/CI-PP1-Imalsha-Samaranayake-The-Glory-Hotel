Note :- This is an imaginary hotel.

#Introduction
The Glory Hotel is a 3 star hotel which situated in Berlin Germany. It has many experience with dealing and providing a well service to their customer. From this website, it is easy to the customer to get to know about this hotel and their services, room prices ect. Also from this website I have provided a easy online booking method to the customer rather than booking through emails and calls.
